# Reddit-image-Fetcher

Please Do not copy this, this is for my school assignment

## More Information
This is a progressive Reddit image fetcher which will fetch recent 100 posts, and will look for any image file in them and download them as JPG file. It uses PRAW so it won't timeout and will only fetch new images when there is no post, so it wont double download recent post.

## Install Neccessary Packages
```
pip install praw wget pandas mime
```
